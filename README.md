- Spacing: Generous padding and consistent gaps
- Borders: Subtle neutral-200 borders
- Hover effects: Red darkens to `#8B0000`, smooth transitions on all interactive elements

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: Wouter (single page)
- **Backend**: Express.js (minimal)

## Admin Access

The application includes a simple admin panel to manage submissions and testimonials.

**Access the admin panel:**
- Navigate to `/admin/login`
- Default credentials:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`

**Important Security Notes for Production:**
1. Change the default admin password before deploying
2. Ensure SESSION_SECRET environment variable is set to a secure random string
3. Consider using a production-ready session store (e.g., connect-pg-simple with PostgreSQL) instead of the default MemoryStore
4. The current setup uses MemoryStore which is suitable for development but not recommended for production deployments

## Publishing

When you're ready to deploy, use the publish button in Replit to make your landing page live with a custom domain.

**Before publishing:**
1. Set a strong SESSION_SECRET in your environment variables
2. Change the admin password (see Admin Access section)
3. Configure your Typeform webhook URL (if using webhooks)

## Pushing Your Changes to GitHub

If you would like to push the latest fixes from this environment to a GitHub repository, you'll need to configure a remote and push from your local machine:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or identify an existing one) without adding any starter files like a README or `.gitignore`.
2. In this project directory, add the remote: `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git`
3. Push the current branch (named `work`) to GitHub: `git push -u origin work`

> **Note:** This hosted workspace does not have GitHub credentials, so pushes must be performed from your own machine or from an environment with the necessary SSH keys or access tokens configured.
